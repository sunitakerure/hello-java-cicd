******CI/CD Automation Project â€“ Jenkins, Maven & Docker(optional)**************

This project demonstrates a basic CI/CD pipeline for automation using Jenkins, Maven, Docker, and Selenium.

Why this note in Jenkinsfile:

-> To explain each pipeline step clearly

-> For easy understanding by others or future reference

In Jenkinsfile
//Linux / Mac
sh 'java -cp bin demoPackage.Hello'


Jenkins pipeline automatically pulls, builds, tests, and deploys your project.
